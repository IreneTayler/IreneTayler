## Engineering Approach

I focus on building frontend systems that are:

- **Scalable** — modular structure, reusable components  
- **Maintainable** — clear separation of concerns  
- **Performant** — lazy loading, memoization, efficient rendering  
- **User-focused** — smooth interactions and clean UX  

Frontend is not just UI — it’s system design on the client side.
