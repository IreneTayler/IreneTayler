## About Me

I'm a React developer with a Software Engineering background (2021).

I enjoy creating interfaces that feel smooth, intuitive, and pleasant to use.  
For me, good frontend is not only about how it looks — it's also about structure, performance, and maintainability.

I like turning complex ideas into simple and elegant user experiences.
